# Axle Mounting Component Manufacturing Project

This project involves the design, measurement, and manufacturing of an axle mounting component for process engineering assignments. The component was measured, designed in CAD software, and manufactured through a series of process engineering steps.

## Project Overview

1. **Objective**: To design and manufacture a 3D model of an axle mounting component, including accurate volume calculations and dimensional measurements.

2. **Process Summary**:
   - **Measurement**: Using a vernier caliper, we measured the dimensions of the real component.
   - **3D Modeling**: Designed the component in Fusion 360 based on the measured dimensions.
   - **3D Printing**: Created a 3D printed model of the component as a prototype.

## Volume Calculation

The total volume removed from the component, excluding internal spline grooves, was calculated as follows:

- **Total Volume Removed**: 148048.231 mm³ (or 148.048 cm³)

## Manufacturing Processes

The component was manufactured through the following processes:

1. **Casting**:
   - *Process*: Liquefying the material in a furnace and pouring it into a mold to solidify.
   - *Tools Used*: Furnace, sand, drag, cope, shovel, rammer, vent wire, mallet, core, two-piece pattern.

2. **Turning**:
   - *Process*: Surface finishing of the casted product on specific features (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6).
   - *Machine Used*: Lathe machine with a single-point cutting tool made of tungsten carbide (WC).

3. **Internal Spline Shaping**:
   - *Process*: Shaping machine used to manufacture an internal spline with 18 teeth.
   - *Tools Used*: Shaping machine, spline adapter, tungsten carbide (WC) cutting tools.

4. **Drilling**:
   - *Process*: Drilling of specific holes (D1, D2, D3, D4) on the component.
   - *Machine Used*: Radial drilling machine with drill bits and end milling cutters made of tungsten carbide (WC).

5. **Boring**:
   - *Process*: Boring of the component to achieve precise internal dimensions.
   - *Machine Used*: Vertical boring mill with end milling cutters made of tungsten carbide (WC).

## Final Output

The 3D printed model and a comprehensive report containing all measurements, volume calculations, and process details are submitted as part of this project.
